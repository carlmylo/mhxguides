Rock Band 3 can delete a song in-game. However, if a song is part of a pack, it'll delete that entire pack as well.

The best way to remove a song from a pack is through Nautilus' `Quick Pack Editor`.

<Steps>
1. Open Nautilus and select `Quick Pack Editor`.
    > <Image src={nautilushomepack} alt="Nautilus' main screen. A cursor hovers over 'Quick Pack Editor'." />

2. Open a file browser window and navigate to the pack's folder that contains the song you want to remove.  
These are usually located in `dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR\`.  
    > <Image src={findpack} alt="A Windows Explorer window. It's showing the USRDIR of Rock Band 3, with various folders that are music packs." />

3. Look for the `songs.dta` file. It will be in the `songs` folder, like `USRDIR\[Pack Name]\songs`.  
    > <Image src={findfolder} alt="A Windows Explorer window. It's showing a 'songs.dta' file within a pack's 'songs' folder." />

4. Drag the `songs.dta` file into the `Quick Pack Editor`.  
    > <Image src={nautiluspackdrag} alt="A `songs.dta` file being dragged into Nautilus' `Quick Pack Editor`." />

5. Change `Quick Pack Editor` to `Edit DTA entries and pack contents`.  
Select the songs you want to remove then click `Remove selected`.  
    > <Image src={nautiluspacksel} alt="'Quick Pack Editor' showing some songs selected. A highlight is over 'Edit DTA entries and pack contents' and the cursor is over 'Remove selected'." />

6. When you're done, click `Save` to apply changes.
