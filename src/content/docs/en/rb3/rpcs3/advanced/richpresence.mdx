Want to show off to others what song you're in or just want to share the love of Rock Band 3 Deluxe?  
You can do this with the Rich Presence script made for Rock Band 3 Deluxe.  
<Image src={discordrp} alt="A Discord profile showing that they're playing Rock Band 3 Deluxe." />

It is compatible with RPCS3, Xbox 360, and PS3!
## Setup
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="RPCS3">
<Steps>
1. First, we're going to disable RPCS3's presence because it will conflict and look weird.  
Open up RPCS3 then click on the `Config` button at the top.  
	> <Image src={rpcs3config} alt="RPCS3 with the cursor hovering over 'Config'" />

2. Under the `GUI` tab, disable `Use Discord Rich Presence`.  
	> <Image src={rpcs3discord} alt="RPCS3 with the 'Use Discord Rich Presence' checkbox disabled." />

3. Now, you'll need to download the latest version of <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Python 3]</a>.  
	<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Click here to go to the download page for Python 3]</a>.  
	* It is suggested to install the standalone installer.
	> <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><Image src={webpython} alt="Python's download website. A cursor hovers over 'Download Python 3.12.6.'." /></a>
4. Once it finishes downloading, open the installer.  
In the installer:  
	* Activate `Add python.exe to PATH`
	* Click `Install now`  
	> <Image src={pyinstall} alt="Python's installer with 'Add python.exe to PATH' and 'Install now' are highlighted in tan with a dotted black outline." />

5. After that finishes installing, you'll need to download the `dx_discordrp.py` script.  
<a href="https://raw.github.com/hmxmilohax/rock-band-3-deluxe/develop/scripts/dx_discordrp.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Right click here and then 'Save link as' to download `dx_discordrp.py`]</a>
	> <Image src={pydl} alt="The dx_discordrp.py script in a browser's downloads." />
	Put it in a folder of your preference.  
Since you'll need to launch this every time you want to do this, it should in an easy to reach spot.

6. Go into the folder where you dropped the file.  
In the address bar at the top of your file browser window, type in `cmd` then press the Enter key.  
	> <Image src={cmdopen} alt="A file browser window with 'cmd' typed into the address bar." />

7. Once the command line window opens up, type in:  
`pip install requests pypresence pylast`  
	> <Image src={cmdpip} alt="A Windows command line, with it runing the 'pip install requests pypresence pylast' command." />

8. After it has successfully installed the dependencies, type in:  
`py dx_discordrp.py`  
into the command line and press the Enter key.  

9. It will ask you to setup a data path for RPCS3.  
Type in `1` and press Enter.  
	> <Image src={cmdrpcs3} alt="A Windows command line, with it runing the 'py dx_discordrp.py' script. It asks the user to select a platform." />

10. After that, you will be asked to enter the path to your RPCS3 installation.  
Drag and drop the folder that contains `dev_hdd0` into the command window then press the Enter key.  
This is usually `C:\Games\RPCS3`.  
**If there are quotes around the path, remove them!**  
	> <Image src={cmdrpcs3dir} alt="A GIF of a Windows command line, with it runing the 'py dx_discordrp.py' script. It asks the user to input the RPCS3 path." />

11. You will be asked whether you want to set up Xbox 360 or PS3.  
If you want to set those up, please check the other platform tabs.
	> <Image src={cmdconsoles} alt="A Windows command line, with it runing the 'py dx_discordrp.py' script. It asks the user to select a platform." />

12. During the last step, you will be asked if you want to set up a Last.fm account.  
Type in `1` and expand the section below if you want to set that up.  
Otherwise, type in `2` to set it up later or `3` to never ask again.

<summary>Scrobbling with Last.Fm</summary>
Do you have a <a href="https://www.last.fm/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Last.fm account]</a> and want to use Rock Band 3 Deluxe to scrobble? You can do just that!
<Steps>
1. Create an <a href="https://www.last.fm/api/account/create" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[API account on Last.fm]</a>.  
Type in the required information, including email, application name, and application description.  
You can name the application whatever you want and give it whatever description you want.
When you're done, click on `Submit`.
	> <a href="https://www.last.fm/api/account/create" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><Image src={lastfm1} alt="A Last.fm API creation page with email, application name, and application description filled out." /></a>

2. After submitting the information, you will be given an `API Key` and an `API Secret`.  
	> <Image src={lastfm2} alt="Last.fm showing that the API account was created. It has the application name, API key, shared secret, and who it's registered to." />

3. Copy those into the command prompt window.  
You will also be asked for your Last.fm username and password.

## Future Usage
After the initial setup, you won't have to set up anything when you open the file again.

All you have to do is double click the `dx_discordrp.py` file.  
> <Image src={pyopen} alt="A file browser window showing the 'dx_discordrp' python script with a cursor over it." />

If you did everything right, it should show that it has connected to Discord RPC successfully and that it's updating presence.  
> <Image src={cmdrun} alt="A Windows command line running the Discord Rich Presence script." />

That's it! Remember to close it out after you're done and to repeat this when you want to open this up again.

If it doesn't open correctly, make sure that you've set Python as the default application for `.py` files.  
> <Image src={pydefault} alt="Windows' default application selection. Python is selected and the cursor is over 'Set Default'." />

If you're on [[the MiloHax Discord]](https://discord.gg/milohax), you can use the `!richpresence` for more information, like getting a "Warped"/"Your Year in Review" stats!
