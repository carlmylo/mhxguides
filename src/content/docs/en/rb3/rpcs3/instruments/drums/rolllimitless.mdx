<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Passthrough (Easiest)">
This method uses Passthrough, which means you don't have to bind anything else. You may have to change the "`Universal Choice`" option to use it in other games or on other consoles.
<Aside type="caution"><Image src={rpcs3nomap} alt="A warning that says not to map this controller!" />  
Do NOT map this instrument via the `Pads` menu!
</Aside>
<Aside type="caution">RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) **will** cause a softlock. You will need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a <a href="../../main#gamepads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[typing keyboard or a gamepad.]</a></Aside>
## Setup
<Steps>
1. Go to <a href="https://rb4.app/#!/RLFirmwares" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Roll Limitless' Firmware website]</a> and download the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bookreader52/rockbandadapternode/raw/master/uf2/drums/RBDrums.uf2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Rock Band Drums firmware]</a>.  
    <a href="https://rb4.app/#!/RLFirmwares" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><Image src={download} alt="Roll Limitless' website with the Drums then Rock Band Drums sections expanded. The cursor is over the 'Download' button." /></a>

2. Put the Roll Limitless Adapter in firmware updating mode.  
If you're on a regular Roll Limitless, press and hold the rectangular button on the top of the adapter, near the micro USB port, while plugging it into a computer.  
    <Image src={fwbutton} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the firmware button circled in red." />

    If you're on a Roll Limitless Mini, press and hold the white `BOOTSEL` button while plugging it into a computer.  
    <Image src={minifwbutton} alt="A Roll Limitless Mini adapter, showing the BOOTSEL button circled in red." />

3. While still holding the button, plug it into your computer. If done successfully, the Roll Limitless will show up as a removable drive.
    <Image src={windevice} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the start button circled in red." />

4. Place the firmware file on the Roll Limitless device while it's in firmware updating mode (showing up as a removable drive).  
    Remove it when it's done.  
    <Aside>Remember to safely eject the device!</Aside>
    <Image src={windrag} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the start button circled in red." />

5. Reconnect your Roll Limitess and set it into firmware mode.  
If you're on a regular Roll Limitless, plug it back into your computer while holding down the round Start button.  
    <Image src={startbutton} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the start button circled in red." />

    If you're on a Roll Limitless Mini, plug it back into your computer while holding the black `SW1` button.
    <Image src={ministartbutton} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the start button circled in red." />

6. Go to <a href="https://rb4.app/#!/RLSettings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Roll Limitless' settings]</a> website in a compatible browser and select your Roll Limitless under `Choose Device`.  

7. Click on `General`.
    <Image src={settings1} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the start button circled in red." />

8. Change `Universal Choice` to `PS3`.
    <Image src={settings2passthrough} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the start button circled in red." />

9. Disconnect the Roll Limitless from the computer then plug it back in.

10. Now, **<a href="https://zadig.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[go to Zadig's website]</a>** and **download the latest version, then open it** up.

11. Click on `Options` then `List All Devices`.  
    <Image src={zadiglistall} alt="Zadig showing 'List All Devices' under 'Options' highlighted." />

12. You should now see devices listed. **Switch it to your Roll Limitless**.  
In this example, it's the Pro Guitar (`Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3`).  
    <Image src={zadigsel} alt="Zadig showing 'Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3' highlighted in the devices listed." />

13. **After selecting the right device, you should see the option to replace the driver.  
_MAKE SURE YOU ARE REPLACING THE DRIVER ONLY FOR THE ROLL LIMITLESS!!_**  
Click `Replace Driver`.  
    <Image src={zadigreplace} alt="Zadig with 'Replace Driver' highlighted." />

14. A warning will appear. **Again, make sure you have selected your Roll Limitless.** After you have made sure, **click** **`Yes`**.  
    <Image src={zadigwarning} alt="Zadig warning the user that they're about to modify a system driver, with 'Yes' highlighted" />

15. It will then install the driver. As the program says, it may take a few minutes.  
    <Image src={zadigprogress} alt="Zadig in the middle of a driver install." />

16. If everything goes well, you will get this message:  
    <Image src={zadigdone} alt="Zadig telling the user that the driver was installed successfully with 'Close' highlighted." />

17. **Close Zadig** and, **with the Roll Limitless** still **connected**, **open up RPCS3** and **open Rock Band 3**.
Turn your controller on and you should see it automatically assign a player number.  
</Steps>

You will see the instrument ready to join in Rock Band 3, .  
<Image src={rb3player} alt="Rock Band 3 with a Pro Guitar ready to join." />

From this point, you can just connect your Roll Limitless whenever you want without having to repeat this setup process!

<details>
<summary>Uninstalling</summary>
Applying a Zadig driver on a device will make it only work on applications with passthrough. Thankfully, reverting this is very easy.  
<Steps>
1. Open the Start menu and search for `Device Manager`. Open it.  
    <Image src={startdevman} alt="Windows' Start menu, with a result of 'Device Manager'." />

2. Scroll down until you find the `Universal Serial Bus devices` category.  
Expand it and right click the instrument you applied the Zadig driver on and then select `Uninstall device`.  
In this example, it's the Pro Guitar (`Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3`).  
    <Image src={devman} alt="Device Manager, with a right click menu that popped up. The cursor is over 'Uninstall Device.'" />

3. In the next window that pops up, make sure to tick `Attempt to remove the driver for this device.`  
4. After that, click `Uninstall` and that's it!  
    <Image src={devmanun} alt="The device uninstall prompt. 'Attempt to remove the driver for this device' is ticked and the cursor is over 'Uninstall.'" />
</Steps>
When you disconnect then reconnect the device, it will revert back to the original driver.

  <TabItem label="Manual Mapping (Universal)">
This method uses XInput, which is more compatible with other rhythm games, but it requires manually mapping (or using a profile) before being able to play.
<Aside>RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) _may_ cause a softlock. You will need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a <a href="../../main#gamepads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[typing keyboard or a gamepad.]</a></Aside>
<details>
<summary>How do I map my drums?</summary>
**Click on the `Pads` icon at the top of RPCS3**.  
<Image src={rpcs3pad} alt="The Pads menu in RPCS3." />

It’s suggested to create a new configuration by clicking `Add Configuration` at the top right of the `Pads` window.  
This is so you can change configuration profiles in case you want to play other games.  
<Image src={rpcs3padprofadd} alt="The top right of RPCS3's Pads window. 'Add Configuration' is being clicked on by the mouse cursor" />
Follow the instructions and/or match the assignments below.

## Pad Information

| Handlers | Devices |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| XInput | XInput Pad |

| Device Class | Device Subtype |
|:------------:|:--------------:|
| Drums | Rock Band Pro |

## Mapping

By default, XInput has most things bound correctly. You only need to remap the following:

| **RPCS3** | **XInput** | **Drums** |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| R1 | ![Left Stick Click](/assets/instruments/buttons/360/lsc.png "Left Stick Click") | ![Second Foot Pedal](/assets/instruments/buttons/drums/rb/kp2.png "Second Foot Pedal") | 
| L3 | ![Right Stick Click](/assets/instruments/buttons/360/rsc.png "Right Stick Click") | Pad Modifier | 
| R3 | ![Right Bumper](/assets/instruments/buttons/360/rb.png "Right Bumper") | Cymbal Modifier |

* Rock Band Drums send multiple button presses out at once. For example, a Red pad will send `B` and `Right Stick Click` (which translates to `Circle` and `L3`.) Keep in mind these are needed to the emulator to tell your cymbals apart.
    * It's strongly suggested to bind an Xbox controller like the Mapping screenshot below then swapping the Device to your Xbox 360 Rock Band Drums.

## Profile
[[Download Profile]](/../downloads/rb3/rpcs3//instrument-repo/Xbox%20Rock%20Band%20Drums.7z)

<details>
<summary>How do I use profiles?</summary>

<Aside type="caution">This is not recommended if you're using multiple controllers at once.</Aside>

After downloading the profile,

1. Extract the .7z file.
2. Drag the `input_configs` folder into the `configs` folder where you have RPCS3 in.  
><Image src={instrepoinstall} alt="Installing a configuration profile from the Instrument Repo" />

3. After that, you can select the profile in the `Pads` menu.  
><Image src={rpcs3padprofile} alt="RPCS3's Gamepad Settings, showing the cursor over a profile." />

Most of the time, these controller profiles should work out of the box. If they don’t, try changing the controller listed in `Devices`, next to the `Refresh` button until it receives an input. You can edit this while the game is running.

<summary>Advanced Mapping</summary>
* To bind multiple buttons to one RPCS3 button, hold Shift then click on the RPCS3 button you want to assign multiple buttons to.
