This is a quick setup guide to get REAPER up and running without having to hunt down lots of files from various places.  
All of the included resources are confirmed working and made for the latest version of REAPER and Python.

<Aside>This will NOT teach you how to chart!</Aside>

Please refer to the old but reliable <a href="http://docs.c3universe.com/rbndocs/index.php?title=Authoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[RBN/C3 Authoring Documentation]</a> as it has stood the test of time.
There is also <a href="https://rhythmgamingworld.com/rock-band-3-customs-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[an amazing book by doa]</a> but keep in mind that certain bits of it suggest installing the outdated version of REAPER. You can and should ignore this.   
Likewise, there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHeGkA4nv4g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[a thorough video by Truce]</a> but once again, you should keep in mind that it may mention that you should install an old version of REAPER. You can and should ignore this.
