* SHIFT+Q - Move closest grid line to mouse cursor while holding.
* SHIFT+L - Import lyrics for selected notes from file.
* ALT+SHIFT+S - Splits a long note along the current grid. Great for quickly creating things like 16th note patterns.

* <a href="https://github.com/mtolly/onyx/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Onyx]</a> - A must have tool if you’re testing on RPCS3 as it can export into a modern PS3 format.
* <a href="https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/releases/download/v5.6/UVR_1_15_25_22_30_BETA_full.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Ultimate Vocal Remover GUI]</a> - Contrary to what the name is, this does a lot more than just remove vocals. This is AI stem separation software that can greatly help in separating a song into separate elements to help with charting. The version linked is a beta version that includes the ability to import Roformer models. Here are the suggested models:
  * Demucs:
    * htdemucs_ft - Separates into four instruments.
    * htdemucs_6s - Gives you six instruments instead of the usual four.
  * MDX-NET
    * <a href="https://rentry.co/UVR-SW-Instructions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[BS Roformer SW]</a> - Like htdemucs_6s but with monumentally superior quality. Requires a beefy graphics card!
    * UVR-MDX-NET INST HQ 3 or 5 - Essential as it usually gives better vocal isolation than Demucs.
    * <a href="https://github.com/jarredou/models/releases/tag/aufr33-jarredou_MDX23C_DrumSep_model_v0.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Drumsep]</a> - Essential as it separates a stereo drum track into various elements. Helps a ton with drum charting.
* <a href="https://mvsep.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Mvsep]</a> - Like UVR but it runs on a server. You are restricted to MP3 quality and there is a queue. You can pay to avoid this.
* <a href="https://therogerland.tumblr.com/proguide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Pro Guitar Guide]</a> - You're probably never gonna touch Pro Guitar/Bass, but for the masochists, this is the only good guide out there.
